# Rusty Sword: Game of Infamy!

Rusty Sword is a terminal-based arcade game used to demonstrate the [Rust] programming language
through live-coding presentations. It has been tested on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## To play

- [Install Rust] if you don't have it already.
- If you are on Linux, install the [Linux dependencies] listed for [rusty_audio]
- Clone the "Rusty Sword" repository, and change directory to it with your terminal. For example:
```
git clone git@github.com:CleanCut/rusty_sword.git
```
- Build and run to play!
```
cargo run --release
```

## Gameplay instructions

- The `â˜¥` represents you, and the arrow symbol next to you is your rusty sword.
- Use arrow keys or WASD keys to move. Your sword will always point in the direction you are moving.
  (You are not particularly skilled at swordfighting, apparently).
- Monsters will attempt to eat you.  If they touch you, they will succeed and the game will be over.
- Touching a monster with your rusty sword will instantly kill it (naturally, since monsters are
  unsafe).
- Have fun!
